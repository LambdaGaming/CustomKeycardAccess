# CustomKeycardAccess
 EXILED plugin for SCP:SL that allows you to change what keycards open what doors. Loosely based on [Faeety's CustomDoorAccess plugin.](https://github.com/Faeety/CustomDoorAccess)

# Notes:
- See your EXILED config for the keycard options. (Make sure you run the server at least once with the plugin so the configs generate.)
- By default, the Facility Guard gains access to the intercom. Below is a list of available keycard and door names.
